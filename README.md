Independent Research Project conducted by Tanner S. and Alex B. under the supervision of Prof. N.L.
We are attempting to make progress on the following problem, attributed to Paul ErdÃ¶s:
"The first game is played on the complete graph, Kn, on n vertices, each pair of vertices being joined by an edge. Left starts by coloring an edge Lilac, and Right replies by coloring another edge Red. They continue to color new edges alternately until all the (n nCr 2) edges are colored. Left wins if he can produce a larger Lilac clique (complete subgraph, Kr) than any of Right's Red cliques. If Right produces a clique as large or larger than any of Left's, then he wins. Erdos conjectures that, for n > 2, the second player, Right, wins."
